# hackDB

- A very simple key/value database written in Java
- Really a glorified (concurrent) hash map with a console
- Provides serialization, import from CSV, some querying
- This little project definitely influenced by the far-superior TextQL: https://github.com/dinedal/textql
- Check http://changepropagation.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/hackdb/ for motivation, etc.
